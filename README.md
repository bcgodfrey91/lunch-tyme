This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In order to run this project locally, you should run the following commands in your terminal:

```
1. git clone https://github.com/bcgodfrey91/lunch-tyme.git
2. cd lunch-tyme
3. npm install
4. npm start
```
This will run the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

I used the following technologies to complete this project:
- React
- CSS
- Google Maps

Additions I might like to include in the future:
- Restaurant descriptions
- Branded, Google Maps icons/pins for each restaurant
- Drawer animations instead of drop downs
- Lazy loading
