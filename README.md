In order to complete this project, I used the following technologies:
- React
- CSS
- Google Maps API
- Fetch API

Given more time, some additions I'd like to include would be:
- Restaurant descriptions
- Branded, Google Maps icons/pins for each restaurant
- Drawer animations instead of drop downs
- Lazy loading

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
